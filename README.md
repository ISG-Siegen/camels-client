# CaMeLS client
### Visit the [repo with the latest CaMeLS implementation](https://github.com/ISG-Siegen/camels) for more resources.

---

## Exemplary implementations for all required files are found in the CaMeLS release through the link above.

## Instructions
1. Write the address of the CaMeLS server into `connection_settings.json`.
2. The file `client_database_identifier.py` should be mirrored with the server.
This happens automatically when connecting to the server.
3. You will need library wrapper files to run evaluations.
These should be distributed by the server host.
4. If the server distributed no custom client routines, you may call the methods in `client_routine.py` to get started.
